<h1>Satoshi Nakamoto</h1>
Satoshi Nakamoto is a person famous as a founder of bitcoin and creator of unique bitcoin client. 
In his P2P Foundation profile he told that he was from Japan. Nothing else is known about him. He was working out his project since 2007 and in 2010 he finished his participation in bitcoin development. The Bitcoin founder is still unknown. Satoshi Nakamoto is the name, by which scientific work setting forward theoretical foundations about bitcoin is signed, so that it is unclear whether it is a pseudonym or not.
On a P2P Foundation profile, he claimed to be a man living in Japan, born on 5 April 1975.

An article about new EZ Flash IV cryptocurrency has been published in 2008 and a year after it there has been published the first software, which has been launched in the network immediately. Nakamoto who was in the role of bitcoin developer continued his discussions on websites with specialists interested in further development of the system. But such a contact between him and his team was going to be weaker and in spring 2011 Satoshi announced his personal exit, as developer told: “In order to be engaged in more important tasks”.

Since then nobody heard about Nakamoto. This person disappeared as unexpected as appeared. The total control over the bitcoin.org domain has been handed to his colleagues including Gevin Anderson – one of the leader developers of the bitcoin. 
It is widely thought that there is no person with such a name. Satoshi Nakamoto is a pseudonym which has been chosen for a certain person or a group of persons, first works setting forward basic crypto currency have been signed by this pseudonym.

This name became a kind of legend and mystery. It is known just that developer of the most popular cryptocurrency has chosen Japan male name, which can be translated as “a wise”. Society perceived his claim about Japan origin incredulously as neither software nor bitcoin customer in Japan exists.

Over a period of several years in mass media has been appeared information that behind the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto hides out a professor of economics and law, whose name is Nik Sabo, an owner of anonymous trading platform – Ross Ulbricht, Japanese mathematician - Motidzuki Siniti and many others. But all of them disproved their belonging to pseudonym and participation in bitcoin creation. 

His identity and nationality are unknown. He is entirely unknown outside of bitcoin as far as anyone can tell, and his (never used) PGP key was created just months prior to the date of the genesis block. He seems to be very familiar with the cryptography mailing list, but there are no non-bitcoin posts from him on it.

He has used an email address from an anonymous mail hosting service (vistomail) as well as one from a free webmail account (gmx.com) and sends mail when connected via Tor. Some have speculated that his entire identity was created in advance in order to protect himself or the network. Perhaps he chose the name Satoshi because it can mean "wisdom" or "reason" and Nakamoto can mean "Central source".

Ultimately the design of bitcoin and its use of cryptographic proof and fully open implementation is one that makes its creator, in a sense, irrelevant and only of interest for historical reasons. 

Satoshi left some clues about why he is doing this project with the inclusion of the following text in the Genesis block, "The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of the second bailout for banks".

Some interesting quotes:
 
    Yes, we will not find a solution to political problems in cryptography, but we can win a major battle in the arms race and gain a new territory of freedom for several years.
    Governments are good at cutting off the heads of a centrally controlled network like Napster, but pure P2P networks like Gnutella and Tor seem to be holding their own. Re: Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper Fri, 07 Nov 2008 09:30:36 -0800
    It's very attractive to the libertarian viewpoint if we can explain it properly. I'm better with code than with words though. Re: bitcoin P2P e-cash paper Fri, 14 Nov 2008 14:29:22

	Why should we know about his personality? Whoever Nakamoto appeared to be – real person, group of the persons or governmental body – it is very important information. It explains cryptocurrency origin and can confirm or disprove wide range of gossip and insinuations existing in BTC exchange. This mystery attracts researches. One of them Skye Grey made a huge work in this direction. He has published a very detailed analysis about text predispositions; this analysis is based on the search of key turn of bitcoin technical documentation, comparing it to works of the researcher of Jorge Washington University , whose name is Nick Szabo.

“Grey: I am not sure that it is Nick Szabo, but I have a lot of independent evidence denoting his side, each of evidence is very interesting”

According to text analysis, just 0.1% of all researches of cryptography were able to reproduce this way of writing. There is a fact that Nick was looking for technical employees for Bit Gold project featured cryptocurrency bitcoin, it has happened a few months before bitcoin announcement but after it, the project has been finished.

Satoshi did not cite Nick Szabo’s works while he was citing another cryptocurrency projects which were less connected with bitcoin.

There was an absence of reaction about bitcoin from the side of Nick Szabo while the decentralized currency topic was the main topic of his research for the last 10 years.

There was a fact that Nick antedated his articles about Bit Gold intentionally in order to look lagged. This began after bitcoin creation announcement.

In his researches, it is noticed that Nick during several years beginning from the 1998 was developing mechanism which allows decentralization of digital currency. In the long run, this mechanism changed to the system named “Bit Gold”, this system is the direct predecessor of bitcoin architecture.
